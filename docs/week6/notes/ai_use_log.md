**Lab 6: Function Calling**

| Tool | Used For | Description |
|------|-----------|--------------|
| ChatGPT | Schema Design | Helped define the nested Pydantic models for `QuizQuestion` to ensure `options` list had exactly 4 items. |
| GitHub Copilot | Boilerplate | Generated the initial `pytest` structure. |
| Claude | Validation | Reviewed the prompt design for extracting concepts to ensure definitions were concise. |

### Notes
AI assisted in scaffolding the Pydantic models, but logic was verified by Beka and Aleksandre.
