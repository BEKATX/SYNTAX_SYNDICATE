# Team Health Check — Week 4
_Last updated: 2025-11-06_

Project: **Cognify**  
Team: **Syntax Syndicate**

This report evaluates team collaboration, communication, and workflow effectiveness after four weeks of the capstone project.

---

## A. What’s Working Well
- **Communication:** Weekly sync meetings on Discord + shared Notion page keep everyone aligned.  
- **Role clarity:** Each member owns one functional area (frontend / backend / AI).  
- **Documentation:** We use consistent folder structure and versioned Markdown docs under `/docs/`.  
- **Feedback culture:** Peer reviews and open discussion of suggestions without conflict.  
- **Accountability:** Tasks assigned in GitHub Projects with clear due dates and follow-ups.

## B. What Needs Improvement
| Area | Issue | Planned Action |
|------|-------|----------------|
| **Time balance** | Some members carry heavier research load | Rotate small maintenance tasks weekly |
| **Technical alignment** | Different coding styles in personal repos | Adopt Prettier + Black for auto-formatting |
| **Decision tracking** | Verbal decisions occasionally lost |
---

## C. Updated Team Contract (Week 4 Revisions)
- **Communication channels:**  
  - Primary – Discord (#dev, #design, #general)  
  - Secondary – GitHub Issues / Pull Requests  
- **Meeting cadence:**  
  - Group chat
- **Decision process:**  
  - Majority vote if consensus not reached
- **Code reviews:**  
  - Always review before merge
- **Documentation expectation:**  
  - Update related `docs/*.md` with every major commit

## D. Risk Mitigation
| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation Plan |
|------|--------------|---------|----------------|
| **Scheduling conflicts** | Medium | Medium | Shared calendar reminders + flexible sub-meetings |
| **Technical skill gaps** | Medium | Medium | Pair-programming sessions twice per week |
| **Falling behind on deliverables** | Low–Medium | High | Weekly backlog review + re-prioritization |
| **Loss of data or repo issues** | Low | High | Daily auto-sync + backup to cloud drive |
| **Burnout / motivation drop** | Medium | Medium | Encourage breaks, acknowledge wins in team chat |

---

## E. Next Steps (Week 5 Outlook)
1. Start implementing **Priority 1** items from `backlog-v2.md`.  
2. Hold a mini design review before merging the ingestion pipeline.  
3. Collect baseline metrics after the first running prototype.  
4. Schedule user-testing recruitment discussion for Week 6.
